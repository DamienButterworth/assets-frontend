# 404 page

404 pages (usually described as a 'page not found') tell users that the page they were trying to access is not there.

{{ example("404-page.html", scaled=true) }}

## When to use a 404 page

There is a chance in all services that people will encounter a 404 page. 
Processes and systems should be put in place to prevent users encountering 404 pages in the first place.

The main reasons you would need to show users a 404 page:

1. if they followed a link (URL) that is broken or pointing to the wrong location
3. if they typed or copied a link incorrectly

When you design the 404 page for your service you need to consider:

- the best way for people to solve the problem
- if there is anything spesific your service can do to help users

## How 404 pages work

When you design the 404 page for your service you need to consider:

- the best way for people to solve the problem
- if there is anything spesific your service can do to help users

{{ example("404-page.html", scaled=true) }}

A 404 page should contain:

- a heading
- an explination of the problem 
- anything the user can do to resolve the problem
- a link to the most appropriate place in your service 

### HTML
{{ markup("404-page.html") }}

## Research on 404 pages

We need more user research on 404 pages. 

We want to know:

- if people are able to resolve the problem on their own
- if people understand what caused the page
- if people understand the content 
- if anything is missing from the content

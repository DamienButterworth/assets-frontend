# Ask users for their consent

This pattern asks users for their consent when we collect and store personal data. The pattern meets our responsibilities under the General Data Protection Regulation 2018 (GDPR) and Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA).

## When to use this pattern

Use this pattern to ask a user for their consent when you collect and store personal data.

Personal data is anything that on its own or together with other data can identify a person.

## How it works

Consent cannot be inferred by someone using a service or doing nothing. It must be:

- freely given
- a positive action to opt-in
- clear, concise and specific
- separate from other terms and conditions
- as easy to withdraw as to give

[Read more about consent on the Information Commissionerâ€™s Office website](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/lawful-basis-for-processing/consent/).

Do not select radio buttons and checkboxes for users. This means the positive action would opt-out.

Consent covers all activities done for the same reason. If there is more than one reason the data is used, get separate consent for each reason.

### Ask a yes-no question

{{ example('ask-users-for-their-consent-yes-no-question.html', scaled=false, cy=false, html=false) }}

### Use a single checkbox

{{ example('ask-users-for-their-consent-checkbox.html', scaled=false, cy=false, html=false) }}

### Use more than one checkbox

For when there is more than one type of consent or consent must be separate from other terms and conditions.

{{ example('ask-users-for-their-consent-checkboxes.html', scaled=false, cy=false, html=false) }}

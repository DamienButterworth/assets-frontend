# Tell users we have confirmed who they are

This pattern lets users know we have confirmed who they are. This is part of confirming who they are when they sign in with a Government Gateway account for the first time.

## When to use this pattern

Use this pattern when we can confirm a user’s identity.

There is also a pattern to [help users when we cannot confirm who they are](/patterns/help-users-when-we-cannot-confirm-who-they-are/index.html).

## How it works

Use the standard page template from your service and have the same:

- header
- phase banner
- footer

The page should have:

- “We have confirmed who you are – service name – GOV.UK” as the page title
- “We have confirmed who you are”
- a “Continue” call to action

{{ example('tell-users-we-have-confirmed-who-they-are.html', scaled=false) }}

Do not use the confirmation page pattern. This is not the end of their journey.

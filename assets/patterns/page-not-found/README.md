# Page not found

{{ wip(104) }}

A page not found tells someone the page they were trying to view cannot be found. They are also known as 404 pages.

{{ example("page-not-found.html", scaled=true) }}

## When to use this pattern

Use a page not found if someone is trying to view a page that does not exist. This happens if someone:

- selects a link or button that takes them to a page that does not exist
- types or copies a web address for a page that does not exist
- types or copies a web address incorrectly

Test all links and buttons to make sure they go where they are supposed to.

Make sure any web addresses in your service, letters, forms and on GOV.UK are for or redirect to pages that exist.

## How it works

The page should use the standard page template from your service and have the same:

- header
- phase banner
- footer

The page should have:

- “Page not found – service name – GOV.UK” as the page title
- “Page not found” as the H1
- contact information, if it exists and helps meet a user need

Contact information should be either:

- a link to a specific GOV.UK contact page not a general contact page
- formatted like a GOV.UK contact page when there is no GOV.UK page

The content should be clear and concise, not blame the user, and not use:

- breadcrumbs
- words like oops, 404, bad request, please and sorry
- red text to warn people

### If you do not know why the page is not found

{{ example("page-not-found-unknown.html", scaled=true) }}

Page after they send the form.

{{ example("page-not-found-sent.html", scaled=true) }}

### Service mistake

{{ example("page-not-found.html", scaled=true) }}

### User mistake

{{ example("page-not-found-user.html", scaled=true) }}

## Research on this pattern

{{ research(104) }}

We want to know if people:

- can fix the problem on their own
- understand what has happened
- understand the content and if there is anything missing
- would use a form to tell us about the problem and if that helps them

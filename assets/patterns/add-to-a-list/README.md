# Add to a list

This pattern lets the user add information with more than one part to a list.

## When to use

Use this pattern when the user needs to add information with more than one part to a list. For example, when they need to enter more than one address or more than one person’s details.

### ​​​​When not to use

Do not use this pattern when the user needs to add different kinds of information that do not relate to each other.

## How it works

Allow the user to:

- view a summary of what they have added to the list</li>
- add things to the list</li>
- [check their answers](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/check-your-answers-pages)
- change things on the list
- remove things from the list

### View a summary of what they have added to the list

{{ example('add-to-list.html', scaled=false, cy=false, html=true) }}

{{ image('Animated example of add to a list pattern that includes asking for name, date of birth, National Insurance number, Unique Taxpayer Reference, and letting you check your answers.', 'add-to-list.gif') }}

### Change things on the list

Show all the information about the entry and let the user make a change.

{{ example('add-to-list-change.html', scaled=false, cy=false, html=true) }}

<!-- {{ image('Animated example of changing a director’s name that includes showing a check your answers type page about the director and changing their name.', 'add-to-list-change.gif') }} -->

### Remove things from the list

Ask the user to confirm they want to remove something from the list.

{{ example('add-to-list-remove.html', scaled=false, cy=false, html=true) }}

<!-- {{ image('Animated example of deleting a director from the list that asks a yes-no question for them to confirm they want to delete the specific director.', 'add-to-list-delete.gif') }} -->

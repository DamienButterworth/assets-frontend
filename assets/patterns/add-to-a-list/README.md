# Add to a list

This pattern enables users to add information with multiple parts to a list, for example, addresses or a person’s details. It lets users know where they are in the process, and what they have already added to the list.

## When to use this pattern

Use this pattern when users need to add multiple sets of the same kind of information to a list.

{{ example('add-to-list-directors-name.html') }}
{{ markup('add-to-list-directors-name.html') }}

{{ example('add-to-list-next-directors-name.html') }}
{{ markup('add-to-list-next-directors-name.html') }}

## ​​​​When not to use this pattern
Do not use this pattern when lists contains multiple sets of different kinds of information. 

## How it works

This pattern allows users to:

* add information with multiple parts to a list, without losing track of what has already been added
​​* view a summary of what has already been added 
* review new information before it is added to the list
* view the complete list

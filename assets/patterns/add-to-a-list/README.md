# Add to a list

This pattern lets users add information with more than one part to a list.

{{ example('add-to-list.html', scaled=false, cy=false, html=false) }}

## When to use this pattern

Use this pattern when users need to add information with more than one part to a list. For example, addresses or a person’s details.

### ​​​​When not to use this pattern

Do not use this pattern when lists contain different kinds of information.

## How it works

Allow users to:

- view a summary of what they have already added to the list
- answer questions about what they are adding to the list
- [check their answers before adding to the list](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/check-your-answers-pages)
- delete and change things on the list

{{ example('add-to-list.html', scaled=false, cy=false, html=true) }}

### Delete something from the list

Get a user to confirm they want to delete something from the list.

{{ example('add-to-list-delete-director.html', scaled=false, cy=false, html=true) }}

{{ image('Animated example of deleting a director from the list that asks a yes-no question for them to confirm they want to delete the specific director.', 'add-to-list-delete.gif') }}

### Change something on the list

Show all the information about the entry and let someone make a change.

{{ example('add-to-list-change.html', scaled=false, cy=false, html=true) }}

{{ image('Animated example of changing a director’s name that includes showing a check your answers type page about the director and changing their name.', 'add-to-list-change.gif') }}

# Help users when we cannot confirm who they are

This pattern tells users we cannot confirm who they are and tells them what they can do next. This is part of confirming who they are when they sign in with a Government Gateway account for the first time.

## When to use this pattern

Use this pattern when we cannot confirm a user’s identity. This may include when a user:

- provides details that do not match those we have on file
- does not complete the process
- does not provide enough information
- makes too many attempts

Doing this helps users to complete the task they are trying to perform. It can also help reduce time and money spent processing queries received by phone and post.

There is also a pattern to tell users we have confirmed who they are.

## How it works

Use the standard page template from your service and have the same:

- header
- phase banner
- footer

The page should have:

- “H1 – service name – GOV.UK” as the page title
- a H1 page heading
- content explaining what went wrong and what they can do
- a call to action

### Avoid ending a journey

Offer the user a way of continuing to use the service where possible.

If this is not possible, provide a way for the user to do what they need to do another way. This could be another service where they do not need to confirm who they are.

### Understand the user’s journey

Work with the team responsible for the microservice that confirms who the user is to understand how the process works. This will help you decide what is the best thing to tell a user to help them complete the process.

### Tell users what they will need to confirm who they are when they start to use the service

List what they need in the ‘before you start’ information where the service starts.

### Give users extra help when they have a deadline

If a user must do something by a specific time and the deadline is close, help them confirm who they are as quickly as possible. For example, a Self Assessment tax return or tax credit renewal.

### Provide help specific to your service

Avoid generic content. Display content that is relevant to the user’s journey.

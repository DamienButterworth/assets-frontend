# HMRC header

The HMRC header shows external users that they are dealing with HMRC.

## When to use

Use this pattern if the user needs to know they are dealing with HMRC. For example, if they need to be sure that a payment is going to the right government department.

## When not to use

Do not use this pattern when the user does not need to know they are dealing with HMRC. Use the [GOV.UK header](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/header/).

Do not use this pattern for:

- personal tax account services – use the [account header](/components/account-header/index.html)
- HMRC internal services – use the [internal header](/patterns/internal-header/index.html)

## How it works

The HMRC header should sit below the [GOV.UK header](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/header/) and the [phase banner](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/phase-banner/), and above the Welsh language toggle.

It should have:

- the HMRC logo
- a vertical teal bar on the left side
- a horizontal grey bar on the bottom

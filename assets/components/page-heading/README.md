# Page heading

This component is the main heading of the current page, which lets the user know what information is being asked for or provided.

## When to use

Use a page heading on every page.

You can also include a section heading if it helps the user know where they are in a service. For example, in long services and those with more than one section.

## How it works

Every page must have a main heading coded as an `<h1>`.

{{ example("page-heading-no-secondary.html", scaled=false, cy=false, html=true) }}

For accessibility reasons, if you use a section heading, it should be coded as a paragraph `<p>` inside a `<header>`.

{{ example("page-heading.html", scaled=false, cy=false, html=true) }}

This makes sure that when using screen readers and other assistive technologies, the page heading and the section heading are:

- separate
- in the correct source order
- displayed the correct way
- read out the correct way

Change or remove any visually hidden content to meet your usersâ€™ needs.

## Research

The recommended code has been tested with screen reader users and all browsers, devices and assistive technologies. Research showed it:

- displayed as expected
- worked consistently across different assistive technologies
- helped users know where they were in the service
- did not distract users from their task

We need more research. If you have used the page heading and section heading, get in touch to share your research findings.

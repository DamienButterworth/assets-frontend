# Components

Components are re-usable parts of the user interface. They are often associated with specific patterns when used in a particular context.

If you use the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_prototype_kit/) the examples should look exactly as they do inside the design system.

## HMRC component library 

Do not use the [component library](https://hmrc-component-library.herokuapp.com) to build new services. Use it to maintain a service that uses assets frontend version 1, 2 or 3.

# Account header

{{ wip(128) }}

The account header is used in, and was specifically designed for, the [personal tax account](https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/personal-account).

{{ example('account-header-example.html', true) }}

## When to use this component

If your service is part of the personal tax account. 

### When not to use this component

If your service is not part of the personal tax account. Use the [hHeader](components/header/index.html) instead.

## How it works

The account header contains:

- [the HMRC cookie banner](/components/header/index.html#the-hmrc-cookie-banner)
- [the GOV.UK header](/components/header/index.html#the-gov.uk-header)
- the [Acount menu](#the-account-menu)
- [the language selector](/components/header/index.html#language-selector) if your service is avalible in Welsh

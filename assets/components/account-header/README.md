# Account header

{{ wip(128) }}

The account header is used for services that are part of the [personal tax account](https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/personal-account).

## When to use

Use this component if your service is part of the personal tax account.

### When not to use

Do not use this component if your service is not part of the personal tax account. Use the [HMRC header](patterns/header/index.html) instead.

## How it works

The account header contains:

- the GOV.UK cookie banner, with a link to HMRC cookie policy</li>
- the [GOV.UK header](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/add-the-govuk-header-and-footer)
- the account menu
- the language selector, if your service is available in Welsh

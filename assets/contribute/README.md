# Contribute to the HMRC Design System

You should design your service using [GOV.UK styles, components and patterns](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design). If the thing you need is not there, you should use the [HMRC Design System](http://hmrc.github.io/assets-frontend/). If you still cannot meet the needs of your users proven by user research, then you can:

* adapt an existing component or pattern
* design a new component or pattern
* propose a new component or pattern

Styles should not be changed without good reason, and any changes should be done in collaboration with GDS.

You can [find out how](contribute/how-to-contribute/index.html) to propose or share a new or adapted component or pattern.

To be considered for inclusion in the HMRC Design System, your pattern or component must be Useful and Unique, as defined by the [GOV.UK Design System Standard](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system/wiki/The-design-system-standard).

When you contribute to the Design System, you should clearly explain how your pattern or component meets these standards and include any user research findings you have.

A member of the [HMRC Design System Working Group](https://github.com/orgs/hmrc/teams/design-system-working-group) will respond to your issue.

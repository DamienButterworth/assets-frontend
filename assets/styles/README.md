# Styles

The core styles that will make your service look and feel like GOV.UK.

Providing you are using the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_prototype_kit/) or have [GOV.UK Frontend](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend) included in your build, the code supplied in the design system should not need any additional styling.

If you're using [HMRC Assets-Frontend](http://github.com/hmrc/assets-frontend) some of these styles will look different until Assets Frontend has been updated to the latest version of GOV.UK Frontend.

Should you need to apply styles manually you should follow existing GOV.UK conventions. For example, don’t assign new meanings to colours, don’t change the styling of buttons or change the thickness of borders on form inputs.

All of the links in this section will take you to the current version of [GOV.UK Elements](http://govuk-elements.herokuapp.com/).
